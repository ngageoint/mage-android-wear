Depends on the [ChronosTouch Library](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-chronostouch-android).  See the [MAGE client](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-android) for more information.

MAGE Wear allows you to quickly create observations using gestures on your wearable device.

MAGE Android Wear was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with BIT Systems. The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the Apache license.

## How to Build

### Build
```bash
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Install Over USB
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

### Install Over Bluetooth

You will need a android device with android wear installed on it.  And you will need to enable bluetooth debugging:  
```bash
adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:/adb-hub  
adb connect localhost:4444  
```

Then install the built apk:  
```bash
adb -s localhost:4444 uninstall mil.nga.giat.mage
adb -s localhost:4444 install ./magewear/build/outputs/apk/magewear-debug.apk  
```

### Build MAGE Android with Wearable Support

In order to use the [MAGE Android client](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-android) with your wearable, you will need to build the wear flavor of MAGE Android:

```bash
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleWearDebug
```
